# Blockchain & Ethereum 101

This talk explains the basics of blockchain, Ethereum, smart contracts and what they add to the software tool kit. Forked from [Dave's slides](https://github.com/DaveAppleton/WWC_ETHKL).

It can be seen at https://talks.godoc.org/github.com/zulhfreelancer/blockchain_101/talk.slide but you should note that the example on slide 6 will not run because `talks.godoc.org` does not support 3rd party packages.
